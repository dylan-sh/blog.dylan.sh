My name is Dylan Garcia, and I'm currently a Technology Management Student at Texas A&M University. This blog's sole purpose is to document anything related to my thoughts and my work. I expect exactly <i>zero</i> people to read it, but I guess there's at least one if you're here.

At the bottom you'll find my LinkedIn and Github, as well as my email. Don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks!

-Dylan
